# Configuration file for GvRng, Guido van Robot Next Generation.
# You can set the language and the printer GvRng will use.
#

# Possible languages are:
# system > Use the systems default language, this defaults to English when the
#          systems language is not supported.
#
# The language is specified by given the locale for that language, so for
# Dutch one should do: lang=nl_NL@euro
# You can only give valid locales. A valid locale is a locale you have
# configured properly on your system.
# For example; you do this, lang=nl_NL@euro, but your system only has a locale
# nl_NL. In this case you will see a error message (stderr) and the GUI would
# be mostly be in English.  
#
# These are examples of locales, the languages are the ones that are currently
# supported by gvrng
#
# nl_NL@euro > Dutch
# ca_Es@euro > Catalan
# fr_FR@euro > French
# ro_RO.utf8 > Romanian
# nb_NO > Norwegian bokmal
# de_DE@euro > German
# es_ES@euro > Spanish

# Printer commands you can use as the value for the 'printercmd' option.
# For example, you have a  Cups printer locally called Epson-Stylus.
# The command should be: lp -d Epson-Stylus
# For a remote Cups printer : lp -h myprinters.com -d Epson-Stylus
# A local default Cups printer: lp
# 
# Expert information
# The printer command is called like this 'printercmd filename'
# So besides a printer command you can use a2ps, enscript etc.
