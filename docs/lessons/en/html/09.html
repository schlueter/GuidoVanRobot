<h1>You Missed Some</h1>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
Recently, you wrote a program to have Guido go down 2nd Street and pick
up trash.  You probably wrote code that used an <code>if</code> statement
("if trash is here, pick it up") followed by a <code>move</code> statement.
Then you copied and pasted that code until you had enough copies of it so
Guido would go all the way down 2nd Street, picking up all the trash.  
</p>
<p>
There is a better way to do a group of statements over and over again:
the <code>do</code> instruction.  The <code>do</code> instruction allows you to 
repeat a set of actions a given number of times.  For instance,
</p>
<pre>do 5:
    move
</pre>
<p>
moves Guido 5 intersections forward.  If you want to repeat multiple
actions, group them together by indenting the instructions the same number
of spaces:
</p>
<pre>do 5:
    putbeeper
    move
</pre>
<p>
Using the same number of spaces to indent is mandatory if you want to repeat
multiple actions. If you mistakenly write
</p>
<pre>do 5:
    putbeeper
move
</pre>
<p>
This code would put 5 beepers at one place and then move forward just one
intersection.  That's probably <em>not</em> what you wanted to happen.  Be
careful to keep indentation the same to keep groups of instructions together
as one block.
</p>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>
<p>
Guido is smarter now and knows about the iterate statement.  He is assigned
once again to pick up trash along Second Street.  Rewrite your solution to 
the previous assignment using Guido's new found power.
