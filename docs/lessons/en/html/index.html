<h1><em>The Roger Frank Lessons</em><br>
Introduction to Computer Science: GvR Unit</h1>
<h2>Programming with GvR</h2>

<p>
Programming a computer in a language like Python requires a precise sequencing
of steps written in a language where details of syntax can be overwhelming for
a beginner. Everything must be exactly right, and errors in just getting the
program to run are frustrating. Often the output of beginning computer programs 
are text-based and uninteresting, at least to humans. 
</p>

<p>
To get acquainted with the concepts of computing without getting bogged down
in the syntax of a higher-level language such as Python, we begin by
programming Guido van Robot. GvR is a teaching tool that presents the concepts
in a visual way using a robot-language that is simple, yet powerful and
extensible.
</p>

<p>
We program Guido, a simple robot that lives in a simple world.  Because Guido
and his world are a visual simulation, we can watch the effects of our
programming statements. This activity is presented in a series of steps --
tutorials with accompanying mini-labs.

<p>
The Guido van Robot programming language is descended from two parent
languages: Karel the Robot and Python.
Karel the Robot was introduced by Richard Pattis in his book
<em>Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming
with Pascal, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1981.</em> 
Python is the creation of Guido van Rossum and members of the Python
community.  Information on Python can be found at:
<a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org</a>
</p>
<p>
GvR was developed by high school computer science students at Yorktown
High School in Arlington, VA, under guidance of mentor Steve Howell.
