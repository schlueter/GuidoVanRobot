<h1>Take Out the Trash</h1>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
The <code>do</code> instruction lets Guido do an action more than once, but
it has a limitation: you must know in advance how many times the action should
be executed.  If you are at an intersection and you need to pick up several
beepers there but you don't know how many there are, you cannot use a
<code>do</code> statement.  The <code>while</code> statement can work in this
situation.
</p>
<p>
The general format of the while instruction is
</p>
<pre>while <em>test-condition-is-true</em>:
    <em>action</em>
</pre>
<p>
where <em>test-condition-is-true</em> is some conditional that evaluates
to either <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>, and <em>action</em>
is either a single command (like <code>move;</code>) or a sequence of commands
in a block.  As long as the tested condition is true, the <em>action</em> will
be performed.  Thus <code>while</code> is similar to <code>do</code> except
that where <code>do</code> specifies a number of times to execute an
instruction, <code>while</code> specifies a test condition.  As long as the
test condition is <tt>true</tt>, the instructions will be executed over
and over.
</p>
<p>
For example, to pick up a stack of beepers you could write
</p>
<pre>while next-to-a-beeper:
    pickbeeper
</pre>
<p>
This says that as long as there are beepers at this intersection, pick one up
and check again.  The result will be that there won't be any beepers at the
current intersection.  They will all be in Guido's beeper bag.
</p>
<p>
Writing a <code>while</code> loop is tricky; there are many details to get
right.  The general steps are
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identify the condition that must be true when Guido is <em>finished</em>
  with the loop.</li>

  <li>Set up your while loop with the test being the <em>opposite</em>
  condition than the one that should finish it:
  <pre>    while <em>opposite condition</em>:
        ...statements here...
  </pre></li>

  <li>Make sure any setup code is complete before starting the loop so you
  start in a known condition.  If conditions are specified, they are called
  <em>preconditions</em>.</li>

  <li>Make sure each pass through the loop makes progress towards completing
  the loop.</li>

  <li>Make sure the test for the loop eventually becomes false so you can get
  out.</li>

  <li>Write code for any cleanup work that needs to be done after executing
  the loop.  When exiting the loop, of <em>postconditions</em> are specified,
  they will have been met if the <em>preconditions</em> were met when the loop
  was entered.</li> 
</ol>
<p>
Watch out for <em>infinite loops</em>, that is, loops that never terminate.  
</p>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>
<p>
It's Monday morning, again.  Before he goes to school, Guido has to take out
the trash.  He's not sure how many bags of trash there are (represented by
beeper bags), but he knows they are in the corner of the room as shown in
<a href="12_files/step12.wld">this</a> world view:
</p>
<p><img alt="Step 12 image" src="12_files/step12.png"></p>
<p>
He needs to pick up all the trash and put it in the dumpster in one trip.
Use one or more <code>while</code> statements to instruct Guido to take out
the trash.  After depositing the trash, have Guido step back to see that
the trash is properly in the dumpster.
