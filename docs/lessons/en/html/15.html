<h1>A Job to Do</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
You have learned a lot about programming Guido. Congratulations!  What you may
not realize is that you have learned a lot about programming in any language.
Most programs are a sequence of steps, interspersed with conditional decisions
and groups of instructions that repeat. All of the projects have been
successively more complex.
</p>
<p>
Implementing the solutions to the assignments so far has required a little 
more thought at each step. You understand the question and the desired result, 
but it's not immediately clear sometimes how to get it done. You should have 
realized that the way you would do it if you were Guido is often the way 
Guido would do it, using the instructions available.
</p>
<p>
Often, then, it's best to figure out how you would accomplish a task. Write 
the steps down in your own words with pencil and paper. This is sometimes 
called pseudocode because it isn't really instructions that Guido could use. 
But it helps you understand what needs to happen. Then you code it -- write 
the real instructions -- to create a GvR program.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to think this assignment through before you start coding. First figure
out the algorithm, or sequence of steps, required. Then, looking at the sample 
world, simulate in your mind the execution of the program you are going to
write.  If it does what you expect, then and only then should you start coding. 
</p>

<h2>Project</h2>
<p>
Guido's Dad is a farmer.  When Guido is not doing his homework, he helps
in the field.  Today he has to harvest the crop.  The field always has
6 rows and 6 columns, but the crop did not grow in all the locations, as
shown.  Create a world with a mostly populated 6x6 field in the middle as
shown.
</p>
<p><img alt="Step 15 image" src="15_files/step15.png"></p>
<p>
Harvest the crop using a nested iterate statement - one or more iterate 
statements within an iterate statement - to perform the harvesting operation.  
In <em>pseudocode</em>, this would be something like:
</p>
<pre>iterate six times 
    go across, harvesting beepers
    go back to left edge
    go up one
stop
</pre>    
<p>but the "go across, harvesting beepers" is an iteration itself:</p>
<pre>iterate six times 
    iterate six times
        go one to the right
        harvest if possible
        go back to left edge
        go up one
stop
</pre>
<p>
Note that <em>pseudocode</em> is not GvR code but a more <q>English-like</q>
description of the algorithm in code-like structure.  Once the pseudocode is
written, turn it into GvR code and execute it to complete this assignment.
</p>

Here is a sample world file for this project, to save you some typing:
