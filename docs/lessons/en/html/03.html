<h1>Turn, Turn, Turn</h1>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
If Guido could only move straight ahead, he would be sad since he could never
go home.  The robot designers were caught in a budget crunch right when they
were making the steering mechanism.  They only gave him the ability to turn
left. Staying at the same intersection, Guido can rotate counter-clockwise,
turning left to face a different direction.  The command for this is, not
surprisingly, <code>turnleft</code>.<br>
</p>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>
<p>
To see how this works, start Guido at the lower left corner facing East.  Have
him take three steps, turn left, three more, turn left, and so on until he is
back at the starting point, facing East once again.
