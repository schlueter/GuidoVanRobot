<h1>Do The Right Thing</h1>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
To keep manufacturing costs down, the factory only built gears in Guido to move
forward and to turn left.  I read in the instruction manual that Guido has the
ability to learn to do other things.  For example, if Guido turns left three
times, he will be facing right.  But you as the robot programmer need to tell
Guido how to do this.
</p>
<p>
We do this by defining a new instruction <code>turnright</code> as a series of
other instructions, specifically three <code>turnleft</code> instructions.
The definition looks like this:
</p>
<pre>define turnright:
    turnleft
    turnleft
    turnleft
</pre>
<p>
This is an example of a <em>compound</em> statement, which means it is made
up of two parts.  The first part consists of <code>define</code> followed
by the name of the instruction you are defining, followed by a colon
(<code>:</code>).  The second part consists of one or more instructions
indented the same number of spaces.  See if you can figure out what this
complete program does.
</p>
<pre>define turnright:
    turnleft
    turnleft
    turnleft
   
move
turnright
move
turnright
move
turnright
move
turnright
turnoff
</pre>

<p>
The three <em>turnleft</em> instructions make up what is called a
<em>block of code</em>, several instructions acting together as one.  All GvR
programs end with a <em>turnoff</em> instruction.
</p>
<p>
You should be able to "hand trace" the operation of this program to
discover that Guido will walk in a small square, returning to his starting
position.
</p>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>
<p>
Once you have defined a new instruction, you can use that instruction as if it
were built-in to GvR.  Define an instruction <code>backup</code> that makes
Guido back up one block, leaving him facing in the same direction.  Then use
<code>backup</code> in a a complete program that has Guido start at the corner
of Second Street and Third avenue, <code>move</code> three blocks north,
<code>backup</code> one block, <code>turnright</code>, and then
<code>move</code> two blocks east.
