<h1>Guido's First Steps</h1>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
Guido van Robot can face in one of four directions, north, east, south, and
west. He turns only 90 degrees at a time, so he can't face northeast, for
instance.  In Guido's world, streets run east-west, and are numbered starting
at 1. There are no zero or negative street numbers.  Avenues run north-south,
and are also numbered starting at 1, with no zero or negative avenue numbers.
At the intersection of a street and avenue is a corner.  Guido moves from
one corner to to the next in a single movement. Because he can only face in one 
of four directions, when he moves he changes his location by one avenue, or by
one street, but not both!  In this step we will create our first world, place
Guido van Robot, and have the little guy take his first few steps.
</p>
<p>
Create a file step01.wld with this line:
</p>
<pre>Robot 4 3 N 0
</pre>
<p>
This creates a world with Guido at 4th Avenue and 3rd Street, facing North.
It should look like this:
</p>
<p><img alt="GvR Step 1" src="01_files/step01.png"></p>
<p>
There are many intersections where Guido can be in this world, since there are
no walls other than those at the edge of the world.  Remember, in Guido's
world, an "avenue" runs north and south and a "street" run
east and west.
</p>
<p>
Now create your first GvR program, calling it step01.gvr
</p>
<pre>move
move
move
move
turnoff
</pre>
<p>
The instructions to Guido will be to move four spaces and then to turn off.
Four small steps for a robot, one giant leap... never mind.  Note that each
command is on its own line.
</p>
<p>
Now load the world (.wld file) and the program (.gvr file) into GvR and
test the code provided.
</p>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>
<p>
Make a world that has Guido start facing East in the lower left corner.  Have
him take three steps and turn off.
</p>
<p>
Hint: you may have to experiment with the numbers and letter after the word
<em>Robot</em> in the world definition file to place him and face him facing
the specified direction.
