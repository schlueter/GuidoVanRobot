<h1>Let's Dance</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Here is a project that combines the <code>do</code> statement with a
user-defined instruction that uses another user-defined instruction.
The user-defined instruction is one to turn around.  It is called by another
user-defined instruction that does one sequence of dance steps described below. 
The sequence is repeated (or iterated) four times.
</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>
Guido lives in Colorado, where country music is popular.  He would like
you to teach him how to line dance.  Line dancing is a series of steps,
up and back, with turns and rotations, with each sequence ending facing in
a different direction.  If the line dancing pattern is repeated, eventually
the dancer will end up at the starting place.
</p>
<p>
The line dance Guido wants to learn is like this.  From the starting position,
take two steps forward, turn around, then three steps back.  Then three
times: turn right, step.  This puts Guido back at his starting spot, but
facing in a different direction.  Repeat this basic step pattern four times
to let Guido dance and have some fun.
