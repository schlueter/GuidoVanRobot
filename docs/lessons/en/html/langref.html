<h1><em>The Roger Frank Lessons</em><br>
Introduction to Computer Science: GvR Unit</h1>
<h2>Guido van Robot Programming Summary</h2>
<p>
<h3>The Five Primitive Guido van Robot Instructions:</h3>
<br>
<pre>
   1. move
   2. turnleft
   3. pickbeeper
   4. putbeeper
   5. turnoff
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Block Structuring</h3>
<br>
Each Guido van Robot instruction must be on a separate line.
A sequence of Guido van Robot instructions can be treated as a single
instruction by indenting the same number of spaces.
&lt;instruction&gt; refers to any of the five primitive instructions above,
the conditional branching or iteration instructions below,
or a user defined instruction.
<pre>
    &lt;instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;
      ...
    &lt;instruction&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<br>
GvR has eighteen built-in tests that are divided into three groups:
the first six are wall tests,<br>
the next four are beeper tests,<br>
and the last eight are compass tests:<br>
<pre>
   1. front_is_clear
   2. front_is_blocked
   3. left_is_clear
   4. left_is_blocked
   5. right_is_clear
   6. right_is_blocked
   7. next_to_a_beeper
   8. not_next_to_a_beeper
   9. any_beepers_in_beeper_bag
  10. no_beepers_in_beeper_bag
  11. facing_north
  12. not_facing_north
  13. facing_south
  14. not_facing_south
  15. facing_east
  16. not_facing_east
  17. facing_west
  18. not_facing_west
</pre>
<h3>Conditional Branching</h3>
<br>
Conditional branching refers to the ability of a program to alter it's flow of
execution based on the result of the evaluation of a conditional.<br>
The three types of conditional branching instructions in Guido van Robot
are <b>if</b> and <b>if/else</b> and <b>if/elif/else</b>.
<b>&lt;test&gt;</b> refers to one of the eighteen conditionals above.
<br>
<pre>
if <test>:
    <instruction>

if <test>:
    <instruction>
else:
    <instruction>

if <test>:
    <instruction>
elif <test>:
    <instruction>
...
elif <test>:
    <instruction>
else:
    <instruction>
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Iteration</h3>
<br>
Iteration refers to the ability of a program to repeate an instruction
(or block of instructions) over and over until some condition is met.
The two types of iteration instructions are the do and while instructions.
&lt;positive_number&gt; must be an integer greater than 0.
<pre>
do <positive_number>:
    <instruction>

while <test>:
    <instruction>
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Defining a New Instruction:</h3>
<br>
New instructions can be created for Guido van Robot using the define statement.
&lt;new_name&gt; can be any sequence of letters or digits as long as it begins with
a letter and is not already used as an instruction.
Letters for Guido van Robot are A..Z, a..z, and the underscore (_) character.
Guido van Robot is case sensitive, so TurnRight, turnright, and turnRight are
all different names.
<pre>
define <new_name>:
    <instruction>
</pre>
